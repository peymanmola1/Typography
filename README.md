This poster is of a @ sign made up of a continuous text of ed balls. I used simple colours in order to emphasise the @ sign in the middle as it is in a red colour, whilst the background consists of black and white.

Justice or Just us is the system broken may be considered quite a political statement and due to what is happening in America the use of red, white and blue will trigger them thoughts.

My thinking behind the CIA tweet was the American flag as it is the secret service of America and I think that people will understand that concept.

For the justice or just us tweet I have made it to resemble a scale balancing justice or just us the colouring is just a simple black and white.

The final poster is the Edward Snowden tweet which all I have done is just make the words get bigger. The colours I choose are yellow and light blue this is because they are quite calming colours.
